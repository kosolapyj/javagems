# Java Gems 2009.02 Release Notes

= Introduction =

This is a maintenance release containing only a few changes.

== Bugfixes ==

  * A bug preventing a logging record creator identification was fixed.
  * A possible swallowed exception behavior in `gems.io.IOUtils.read()` was fixed.

== Enhancements ==

  * Better usage of generics was applied through codebase. Many interfaces are now more flexible but still type safe and almost all _unchecked assignments_ simply disapeared. 
  * As part of bugfixing, a refactoring was performed. The result is that there is a new general-purpose interface named [http://code.google.com/p/javagems/source/browse/trunk/srcs/gems/ExceptionHandler.java ExceptionHandler]. It is useful for a pluggable exception handling.
