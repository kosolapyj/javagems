== Best practices == 

Even if this design gem is useful, do not overuse it blindly. Very often a better solution exists: Empty collection or zero-lenght array can be returned as safe return value. Where an instance of an interface is required, its _null-implementation_ could be the perfect sentinel value. Nota bene, `Option` wrapper is quite good for a return value, but it is only seldom a smart choice for input attribute. However, this is also possible ...
